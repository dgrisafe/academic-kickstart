**What is a Qualifying Exam?**

The [USC Department of Preventive Medicine](https://catalogue.usc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=7&poid=6836&returnto=1755) defines the qualifying exam for the PhD in epidemiology as a proposal to the research committee.  

> "The oral portion will be a seminar-style presentation to the Qualifying Exam Committee, focusing on the dissertation proposal, followed by questions from the Committee on both the proposal and the student's general mastery of the field."  

**Committee Members**

The committee included medical researchers and physicians with expertise in fields related to my dissertation. I have developed my research projects under guidance and mentorship of each committee member. The professors include:  

- [Roberta McKean-Cowdin, PhD](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/roberta-mckean-cowdin/)  

- [Wendy Mack, PhD](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/wendy-jean-mack/)  

- [Cecilia Patino-Sutton, MD, PhD](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/cecilia-patino-sutton/)  

- [Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati, PhD, MPH](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/lourdes-baez-conde/)  

- [Benjamin Xu, MD, PhD](https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/benjamin-yixing-xu/)
