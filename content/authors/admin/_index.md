I am a medical student and a chronic disease epidemiologist interested in how risk exposures affect disease outcomes at the population level.

As a [postdoctoral fellow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10VWMRnFBfFJxueXct3npUaVkrcL0fiWs/view?usp=sharing) I learned bioinformatics while investigating the multi-omics of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in cohorts of European children.

During my [doctoral dissertation](http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll89/id/318788) in clinical and environmental epidemiology I studied eye disease among multiethnic, aging adults from Southern California.
