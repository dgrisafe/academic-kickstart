I study chronic disease epidemiology, a field that explores how exposures are related to disease in specific populations. In June of 2020 I began a postdoctoral fellowship in [Environmental Omics](https://scehsc.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/USC-EnvGen-T32-PostDoc-Announcement.pdf) to learn how environmental exposures interact with the genetics and biochemistry of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in pregnant mothers and their children.

During graduate school I completed my dissertation titled [Chronic Eye Disease Epidemiology in the Multiethnic Ophthalmology Cohorts of California Study](http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll89/id/318788). The primary aims included (1) investigating how quality of life related to vision is impacted by visual impairment among the most populous US racial/ethnic groups, and (2) elucidating whether the retinal pathophysioloy of primary open angle glaucoma is associated with traffic-related air pollution in African Americans.
