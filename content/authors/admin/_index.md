I am an MD/PhD Candidate training in chronic disease epidemiology at the University of Southern California.

I study population-based, multiethnic cohorts of eye disease based in Los Angeles County. My recent interests include applied statistics, visual impairment, and vision-specific quality of life.

I am pursuing coursework in clinical trials to understand how scientific research is translated into medical solutions for patients.
