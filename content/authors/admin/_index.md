I study chronic disease epidemiology, a field that explores how exposures relate to health outcomes in specific populations. 

In June of 2020 I began a postdoctoral fellowship in [Environmental Omics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10VWMRnFBfFJxueXct3npUaVkrcL0fiWs/view?usp=sharing). I am learning multi-omics methods to integrate the genetics and biochemistry of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in children.

My dissertation was titled [Chronic Eye Disease Epidemiology in the Multiethnic Ophthalmology Cohorts of California Study](http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll89/id/318788). The primary aims included (1) investigating how visual impairment impacts quality of life related to vision among the most populous US racial/ethnic groups, and (2) elucidating whether traffic-related air pollution is associated with the retinal pathophysiology of primary open angle glaucoma in African Americans.
