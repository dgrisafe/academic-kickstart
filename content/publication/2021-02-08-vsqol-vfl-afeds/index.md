summary: 'African Americans endure a disproportionate burden of visual impairment. Vision quality of life was characterized by daily tasks and emotional well-being. Field loss had the greatest impact on completing daily visual tasks. A meaningful change in visual task was associated with 6 dB lower visual field. Preventing visual field loss is important for preserving vision quality of life.'

**Purpose**  

To elucidate how visual field loss (VFL) impacts self-reported vision-specific quality of life (VSQOL) in African Americans, who experience a disproportionate burden of visual impairment.

**Design**  

 Cross-sectional, population-based cohort
 
**Methods**  

Eligible participants (n = 7,957) were recruited who self-identified as African American, were 40 years or older and resided in Inglewood, California. 6,347 participants (80.0%) completed clinical eye exams. Total mean deviation (MD) of VFL was measured bilaterally as decibels (dB) using the Humphrey SITA Standard 24-2 test. VSQOL was measured using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and scored using item response theory (IRT). 

**Results**  

Participants with reliable data (n = 5,121) had a mean age of 60.7 years (SD 11.0); those with worse VFL were older, had more comorbidities, lower income, less education, worse visual acuity, and were more likely to be unemployed and depressed. Using IRT analysis, a change in VF of 6.2 (95% CI: 5.3, 7.7) dB and 9.2 (95% CI: 7.5, 11.9) dB was necessary to observe a meaningful (5-point) difference in vision-related task and emotional well-being scores, respectively. VFL had the greatest impact on self-reported driving ability (6.0 dB [95% CI: 5.2, 7.1]), followed by satisfaction with general vision, near vision, vision-related mental health, and peripheral vision. 

**Conclusions**  

The strongest impact of VFL reported by African Americans was on their ability to complete visual tasks, especially for driving. An effect of VFL on emotional well-being also was observed, but the magnitude of association was about 50% lower for well-being compared to that of task.
