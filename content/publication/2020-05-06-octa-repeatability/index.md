summary: 'Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a novel method of measuring blood flow through the retina of the eye. FDA approval was obtained for OCTA in 2015. The reliability, reproducibility, and repeatability of OCTA have not been characterized in patients with glaucoma and normal eyes. OCTA parameters were highly repeatable during the same visit.'

**Objective** 

To compare intrasession repeatability versus intersession reproducibility of the peripapillary vessel parameters using optical microangiography-based optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in non-glaucomatous and glaucomatous eyes.

**Methods**

In an observational, longitudinal study, peripapillary OCTA scans were collected to evaluate intrasession repeatability and intersession reproducibility using within-eye coefficient of variation (CVW) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Images were quantified using a custom research-oriented quantification software calculating vessel area density (VAD) and flux and a commercially developed, clinic-oriented quantification software (Cirrus 11.0, Carl Zeiss Meditec) calculating perfusion density (PD) and flux index (FI). Effect of signal strength on the reliability of OCTA parameters was also evaluated.

**Results**

Among 120 non-glaucomatous eyes, intrasession CVW were 4.2% for VAD, 5.3% for flux, 1.5% for PD and 2.0% for FI. The intersession CVW were 6.5% for VAD, 8.0% for flux, 2.0% for PD and 3.2% for FI. The intrasession ICC ranged from 0.928 to 0.945, and intersession ICC ranged from 0.811 to 0.866. From 118 glaucomatous eyes, intrasession CVW was 9.0% for VAD, 10.3% for flux, 1.7% for PD and 2.3% for FI. The intersession CVW was 12.1% for VAD, 14.2% for flux, 2.3% for PD and 3.5% for FI. The intrasession ICC ranged from 0.904 to 0.972, and intersession ICC ranged from 0.855 to 0.955. Signal strength was significantly positively associated with OCTA vessel parameters (p<0.0001) for both groups.

**Conclusion**

Peripapillary OCTA vessel parameters had greater intrasession repeatability compared to intersession reproducibility in both non-glaucomatous and glaucomatous eyes. The built-in commercially developed quantification software demonstrated greater agreement than the custom research-oriented quantification software.
