#Directions

Access these decks by logging into your USC email.

These decks are stored on USCâ€™s google drive. They can only be accessed by people with USC gmail accounts.

#How to Study

All decks contain:  

1. Image occlusions of dissection images  

2. Cloze deletions of the alphabetical list of the soft-tissue structures from the end of each section in the dissection guide  

The image occlusions are ready to study.  

The cloze deletions have been suspended because they are more time intensive. Unsuspend these cards if time allows.
